# Star Wars: Fury — Hyperspace Event Generator v5.3

**Era Lock:**  
**Date:** 10,538 BBY — Late Mandalorian Wars / cusp of Jedi–Sith War  
Darth Vitiate’s rise within the Old Republic Sith Empire has begun. The Galactic Republic is strained at the fringes. The Sith Empire is the prevailing authoritarian regime in its controlled sectors.

**Setting Restrictions:**  
- **DO NOT USE** characters, factions, ships, planets, technology, or events from the film eras, Clone Wars, Palpatine/Vader Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, or New Republic.
- Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, X-Wings, and analogous designs **do not exist**.
- Any “Empire” refers to the **Sith Empire** of this period.
- Any “Imperial” means **Sith Imperial** — including military, naval, and intelligence divisions, led by the Dark Council and influenced by Darth Vitiate.
- **Tone/design:** KOTOR/SWTOR Old Republic era — war-torn, culturally diverse, ancient Force traditions, powerful Sith lineages, Mandalorian raids, and emerging galactic conflict.

*When in doubt, consult Old Republic Legends material or analogous designs fitting this setting.*

## Purpose

Hyperspace is the **party’s “campsite”** — a safe, narrative-rich downtime phase between major events.

It exists to:

- React immediately to recent scenes
- Allow for training, repairs, bonding, and recovery (gaining/losing perks, skills, buffs/debuffs, equipment)
- Hold a **Mission Council** for strategy, intentions, and asset redistribution before the next stage

Hyperspace events **only occur** if there is plausible narrative time and safety.

## Core Principles & Rules

### 1. **Trigger Conditions**

Hyperspace Event Generator is invoked only if:
- The party is in safe hyperspace travel or confirmed downtime between missions
- There is narrative breathing room (no active pursuit, combat, or emergency)
- GM/AI agrees a scene pause fits pacing and character development

### 2. **Hyperspace Cycle Structure**

- **Phase 1: Immediate Reaction**  
  Address emotional/strategic fallout from recent events. NPCs may confront, comfort, or challenge PCs. Bond or Heat shifts may occur.

- **Phase 2: Training, Bonding, Recovery**  
  Downtime activities: train, repair, upgrade gear, heal, or personal roleplay.  
  - Bond/Heat (–5 to +5) values can shift: high Bond improves cooperation; low Bond increases tension.  
  - Perks, debuffs, buffs, or equipment upgrades may be gained or lost.

- **Phase 3: Mission Council**  
  Strategic discussion before the next mission.  
  - Clarifies PC intentions  
  - Allows for last-minute loadout changes  
  - GM probes goals and seeds future challenges

### 3. **Probability-Weighted Events**

- **Faction Heat** and **Bond** act as probabilistic modifiers:
  - **Negative values:** bias odds toward conflict or negative outcomes
  - **Positive values:** bias odds toward aid or beneficial moments
  - **0:** Neutral, no advantage
- Values **affect likelihood, not guarantee** — narrative logic and “Commander’s Discretion” override results
- Recommended: roll d6/d12/d20, modified by ±Heat/Bond for relationship or faction

### 4. **GM Best Practices**

- Consult "Story So Far" transcripts for tone and continuity
- Ensure events naturally extend ongoing plots/NPC arcs
- Avoid filler; even light events should suggest future story beats
- Record all consequences & update reference sheets immediately
