Star Wars: Fury — Complications & Events Table v5.3
How To Use:
These tables provide complications that may arise dynamically.
Heat/Bond values are probabilistic modifiers — they affect rolls, not direct triggers. Always balance dice results with narrative logic, pacing, and tone.

Era Lock
Date: 10,538 BBY — Late Mandalorian Wars / cusp of Jedi–Sith War.

Setting: Darth Vitiate’s rise within Old Republic Sith Empire. Galactic Republic exists but is strained. Sith Empire is the prevailing authoritarian regime.

Restrictions:

DO NOT use characters, factions, ships, planets, technology, or events from film eras, the Clone Wars, the Palpatine/Vader Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, or New Republic.

Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, X‑Wings, etc. do not exist.

“Empire” and “Imperial” always refer to the Sith Empire and Sith Imperial military/navy led by the Dark Council, influenced by Darth Vitiate.

Tone: Matches KOTOR/SWTOR Old Republic — war-torn, culturally diverse, ancient Force traditions, powerful Sith lineages, Mandalorian raids, emerging galactic conflict.

When in doubt, consult Old Republic Legends or analogous design material.

Usage Instructions
Roll or select a complication that fits the current Scene Type: Combat, Social, Technical, Exploration.

Modify event probability using relevant Faction Heat (-5 to +5) or Bond (-5 to +5) modifiers.

Values bias rolls toward or away from event triggers, but do not guarantee outcomes.

GM/AI may override rolls if contradicted by hard narrative logic or pacing.

Apply consequences only if the roll succeeds.

Complications Tables
1. Combat Complications
Tier	Complication	Effects (Probability-Weighted)
Minor	Enemy patrol detects the party	Roll for engagement (e.g., 1d10). Heat mod: negative = more likely combat, positive = less likely. Knocked State only if combat occurs.
Moderate	Mid-fight reinforcements arrive	Roll for arrival; Heat mod for controlling faction. On success: +1–2 Faction Heat, possible flank/surround.
Major	Environmental hazard disrupts battle	Check hazard trigger with situational modifier; Knocked State risk to wounded PCs. Failure = major resource loss.
2. Social Complications
Tier	Complication	Effects (Probability-Weighted)
Minor	Misunderstanding causes mistrust	Roll vs Bond: lower/negative Bond increases chance. On trigger: Bond –1 until resolved via RP.
Moderate	Suspicion during formal meeting	Roll vs average Bond; on trigger: +1 local Faction Heat, persuasion penalties in scene.
Major	Ally betrayal attempt	Roll vs Bond with betrayer; negatives heavily weigh toward betrayal. On trigger: Bond set to –3 or lower, adjust Faction Heat.
3. Technical Complications
Tier	Complication	Effects (Probability-Weighted)
Minor	Minor system malfunction	Roll base chance; Bond mod if tech support is involved. On trigger: lose 1 system until repaired.
Moderate	Sabotage discovered	Roll vs Heat OR Bond with suspect. On trigger: +1–2 Faction Heat; Bond penalty if suspect is crew.
Major	Core system failure	Roll base chance; mod from recent combat/exploration. On trigger: resource drain, morale penalty, Bond stress.
4. Exploration Complications
Tier	Complication	Effects (Probability-Weighted)
Minor	Hostile terrain delays progress	Roll vs hazard table; apply local Heat if delay can be exploited. On trigger: resource loss, +1 Heat in hostile space.
Moderate	Dangerous wildlife/militia opposition	Roll for encounter; Bond applies to militia/NPCs. On trigger: injury risk, possible Knocked State.
Major	Natural disaster forces diversion	Roll; Heat mod for rescue/intervention. On trigger: injury, major resource loss, possible new faction contact.
Probability Application Example
Identify the complication type & tier (e.g., Combat/Moderate).

Determine related Faction Heat or Bond score from Codex.

Negative Heat = higher hostile odds

Positive Heat = higher helpful odds (lower hostile odds)

Roll base chance (GM-determined, e.g., 40%).

Apply Heat/Bond as percentage modifiers or dice advantage/disadvantage.

Resolve and narrate outcome logically. Update Heat/Bond only if the event occurs.
