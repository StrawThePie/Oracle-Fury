***

## Era Lock

> **Date:** 10,538 BBY  
> *Late Mandalorian Wars / cusp of Jedi–Sith War. Darth Vitiate’s rise within the Old Republic Sith Empire has begun. The Galactic Republic exists but is strained at the fringes. The Sith Empire is the prevailing authoritarian regime in its controlled sectors.*

- **DO NOT USE**: Characters, factions, ships, planets, technology, or events from the film eras, Clone Wars, Palpatine/Vader’s Empire, Rebel Alliance, or New Republic.  
- *Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, X‑Wings, etc., do not exist.*  
- References to “Empire” mean the **Sith Empire** of this era.  
- “Imperial” refers to **Sith Imperial** military/naval/intelligence arms, led by the Dark Council and influenced by Darth Vitiate.  
- **Tone/Aesthetic:** KOTOR/SWTOR Old Republic, war‑torn, ancient Force traditions, powerful Sith lineages, Mandalorian raids, emerging galactic conflict.  
- *Consult Old Republic Legends material when uncertain.*

## Bond as Probabilistic Modifier

> **Bond** is on a scale of –5 to +5 and alters the likelihood of cooperation, loyalty, or betrayal:
> - High positive Bond: improves odds for NPC help (never guarantees).
> - High negative Bond: decreases odds (doesn’t force betrayal).
> - Always blend with narrative context, GM discretion, and safety standards.
