Era Lock
Date: 10,538 BBY
Late Mandalorian Wars — cusp of Jedi–Sith War

Setting:

Darth Vitiate’s rise within the Old Republic Sith Empire has begun.

The Galactic Republic exists, but is strained at the fringes.

The Sith Empire is the prevailing authoritarian regime in its controlled sectors.

STRICT CANON GUIDELINES:

DO NOT use characters, factions, ships, planets, technology, or events from the film eras, Clone Wars, Palpatine/Vader Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, or New Republic.

Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, X‑Wings, and similar designs do not exist.

Any “Empire” refers to the Sith Empire of this period.

Any “Imperial” means Sith Imperial — military, naval, and intelligence arms of that Empire, led by the Dark Council and influenced by Darth Vitiate.

Tone/Aesthetic:

Matches the KOTOR/SWTOR Old Republic era.

Expect: war‑torn, culturally diverse, ancient Force traditions, powerful Sith lineages, Mandalorian raids, and emerging galactic conflict.

When unsure, consult Old Republic Legends material or analogous designs fitting this setting.
