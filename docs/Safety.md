### Safety Policy

- Age: teen/mature/adult-only. Content must not exceed the session's age level.
- Consent: explicit requires clear consensual framing; non-consensual content is blocked.
- Violence: low/moderate/high controls graphic detail; redact gore at low.
- Protected Tags: module-defined sensitive terms that trigger redaction.

Override (Commanderâ€™s Discretion)
- Provide reason and scope (e.g., allow:violence:moderate for scene:123).
- Append-only hash-chain audit log; tampering invalidates verification.
