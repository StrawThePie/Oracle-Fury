### Oracle Fury Rulebook

- Relationships: Heat/Bond in [-5, +5], decay each downtime (Heat +/-1 toward 0; Bond +/-0.5 toward 0).
- Downtime Phases: Hyperspace, Camp, Base. Each exposes phase-specific actions.
- Resolution: p' = sigmoid(logit(p) + Î£ weights). Success if p' >= 0.5. Show trace of modifiers.
- Dice: Expressions like NdM+K (e.g., 2d6+1) rolled with seeded RNG.
