Era Lock
Date: 10,538 BBY — Late Mandalorian Wars / cusp of Jedi–Sith War
Darth Vitiate’s rise within the Old Republic Sith Empire has begun. The Galactic Republic exists but is strained at the fringes. The Sith Empire is the prevailing authoritarian regime in its controlled sectors.

DO NOT use characters, factions, ships, planets, technology, or events from the film eras, the Clone Wars, the Palpatine/Vader Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, or New Republic. Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, X‑Wings, and similar designs do not exist.

Any “Empire” refers to the Sith Empire of this period.

Any “Imperial” means Sith Imperial — military, naval, and intelligence arms of that Empire, led by the Dark Council and influenced by Darth Vitiate.

Tone/design aesthetic must match the KOTOR/SWTOR Old Republic era — war-torn, culturally diverse, ancient Force traditions, powerful Sith lineages, Mandalorian raids, and emerging galactic conflict.

When in doubt, consult Old Republic Legends materials or choose analogous designs fitting this setting.

Heat vs Party as Chance Modifier
Follows same rules as Faction Heat—affects odds of personal intervention/escalation, but does not automatically trigger actions.
