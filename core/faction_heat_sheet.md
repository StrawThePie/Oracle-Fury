# Era Lock

**Date:** 10,538 BBY — Late Mandalorian Wars / cusp of Jedi–Sith War  
- Darth Vitiate’s rise within the Old Republic Sith Empire has begun.  
- The Galactic Republic exists but is strained at the fringes.  
- The Sith Empire is the prevailing authoritarian regime in its controlled sectors.

> **Restriction:**  
> DO NOT use any characters, factions, ships, planets, technology, or events from the film eras, Clone Wars, Palpatine/Vader Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, or New Republic periods.  
> Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, X‑Wings, and similar designs do **not** exist.

**Definitions:**  
- “Empire” refers to the **Sith Empire** of this era.  
- “Imperial” means **Sith Imperial** — military, naval, and intelligence under the Dark Council, rising influence of Darth Vitiate.

**Tone & Design Aesthetic:**  
- Matches the **KOTOR/SWTOR Old Republic era**: war-torn, culturally diverse, ancient Force traditions, powerful Sith lineages, Mandalorian raids, emerging galactic conflict.
- When uncertain, consult Old Republic Legends or analogous setting material.

# Faction Heat as a Probabilistic Modifier

- **Heat (-5 to +5)** influences how likely a faction is to help, hinder, or seek out the party.
- Used as a *weight* for event rolls or narrative outcomes, **not** as an absolute trigger.
- Extremes (+5, -5) heavily bias toward major action, but final results should suit story pacing and logic.
